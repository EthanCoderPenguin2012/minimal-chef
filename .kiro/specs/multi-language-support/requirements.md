# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for adding multi-language support to the application. The feature will enable users to view and interact with the application in their preferred language, making it more accessible to a global audience. The implementation will include a language selection mechanism, translation management, and proper localization of all user-facing content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Language Selection

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select my preferred language, so that I can use the application in a language I'm comfortable with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user first visits the application THEN the system SHALL detect their browser/system language and use it as the default if supported.
2. WHEN a user manually selects a language THEN the system SHALL immediately apply the selected language to the user interface.
3. WHEN a user selects a language THEN the system SHALL persist this preference for future sessions.
4. WHEN a user returns to the application THEN the system SHALL use their previously selected language preference.
5. IF the detected or selected language is not supported THEN the system SHALL default to English.

### Requirement 2: Language Coverage

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive language coverage throughout the application, so that I have a consistent experience in my chosen language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any text is displayed in the UI THEN the system SHALL show it in the user's selected language.
2. WHEN displaying dates, times, and numbers THEN the system SHALL format them according to the conventions of the selected language/locale.
3. WHEN displaying currency values THEN the system SHALL format them according to the conventions of the selected language/locale.
4. WHEN displaying direction-sensitive content THEN the system SHALL support right-to-left (RTL) languages appropriately.
5. WHEN a translation is missing for a specific text THEN the system SHALL fall back to English rather than showing an error or blank space.

### Requirement 3: Translation Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an efficient translation management system, so that I can easily add and update translations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a new language THEN the system SHALL only require adding translation files without code changes.
2. WHEN adding new text to the application THEN the system SHALL have a clear process for marking it for translation.
3. WHEN translations need to be updated THEN the system SHALL provide a mechanism to do so without requiring a full application rebuild.
4. WHEN a new language is added THEN the system SHALL make it immediately available to users.
5. WHEN managing translations THEN the system SHALL support a hierarchical structure for organizing translation keys.

### Requirement 4: Performance Considerations

**User Story:** As a user, I want language switching to be fast and efficient, so that my experience is not degraded when using non-English languages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user switches languages THEN the system SHALL apply the change in under 500ms.
2. WHEN loading the application THEN the system SHALL only load translation resources for the current language to minimize bundle size.
3. WHEN a user navigates between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain the selected language without flickering or temporarily showing content in a different language.
4. WHEN using the application in any language THEN the system SHALL maintain comparable performance to the English version.

### Requirement 5: Accessibility and Usability

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the multi-language support to work well with assistive technologies, so that I can use the application regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the language is changed THEN the system SHALL update the lang attribute in the HTML to match the selected language.
2. WHEN text is translated THEN the system SHALL preserve all accessibility attributes and ARIA labels.
3. WHEN the language direction changes (LTR/RTL) THEN the system SHALL properly adjust the layout and UI components.
4. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL announce content in the correct language.
5. WHEN the font size is increased for accessibility THEN the system SHALL ensure translated text still fits appropriately in UI components.
